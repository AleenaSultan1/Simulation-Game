## Project Information
This is a Java-based 2D game simulating the famous Dungeon Crawler type game. The player explores DANA 325 where the 
ultimate mission is to defeat the final boss - Professor Lily. The storyline unfolds across 3 progressively challenging 
levels. The first level is the exploration phase, where the player navigates through the map to interact with objects 
such as swords, chest which forces the player to solve riddles to get equipped, and magic dust. Once the play is 
equipped, he can get to the next level through an evil teleporting portal.

The player then enters the combat phase in level 2 and level 3. In level 2, the player interacts with the notorious TA 
goon squad and the player has to defeat Professor Lily in the last level to win the game. The combat system is simple 
yet engaging melee mechanic where player must strategically approach enemies, manage health, and make use of items 
collected to survive. With a tile-based map rendering system, dynamic entity animations, and support for multiple game starts, 
the game blends object-oriented programming principles with event-driven game logic to deliver an immersive, narrative-driven 
gameplay experience.
